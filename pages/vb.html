                            <p>As a passionate Python developer, I have created several backend applications that demonstrate my ability to build robust and efficient systems. 
                                My projects focus on practical solutions to real-world problems, emphasizing user experience, security, and performance.

                            <div class = title>File Transfer Application</div>
                            The File Transfer Application is a simple client-server application developed in VB.NET that enables users to send and receive files over a network using TCP sockets. Utilizing the Winsock2005DLL for handling network connections and file transfers, this application features a user-friendly graphical interface to streamline the file transfer process.
                            <p>This project was developed during my internship in Italy, where I gained valuable hands-on experience with network programming and client-server architecture.</p>
                            <p>The application consists of two main components: the Sender and the Receiver. Users can set up either role to initiate or accept file transfers, making it flexible for various networking scenarios.</p>
                            Features:
                            <ul>
                                    <li><b>Send Files:</b> Users can browse and select files to send to a specified IP address and port.</li>
                                    <li><b>Receive Files:</b> The application can listen for incoming file transfers on a designated port.</li>
                                    <li><b>Progress Bar:</b> Users are provided with a visual indication of the file transfer progress, enhancing user experience.</li>
                                    <li><b>Error Handling:</b> The application includes mechanisms for error handling to ensure robust file transfer processes.</li>
                            </ul>
                                Code Structure:
                                
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Main Form (Form1):</b>The main interface of the application, containing controls for sending and receiving files.</li>
                                    <li><b>Winsock Controls:</b> Listens for incoming connections and manages received data and connects to the server for sending data.</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                Event Handlers:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Initializes the server to listen for incoming connections on the specified port.</li>
                                    <li>Connects the client to the specified server IP address and port.</li>
                                    <li>Opens a file dialog for users to select files for sending.</li>
                                    <li>Sends the selected file to the connected server.</li>
                                    <li>Accepts incoming connection requests from clients.</li>
                                    <li>Processes incoming data and files.</li>
                                    <li>Updates the progress bar to reflect the current transfer status.</li>
                                </ul>
