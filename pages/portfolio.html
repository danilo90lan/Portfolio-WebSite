                        <p>Hi, I'm Danilo, I'm currently studying Web developing.
                            It's something i was always passionated about and my goal in the near future is to work as full stack developer and 
                            I'm willing to put all the effort towards this achievement.
                            I did study in the past, back in my country, coding and computer science but it was long time ago.
                            In my country I also did an internship for an IT company, and my role was to work on a project with a team developing a program in VB.NET using .NET Framework.
                            Unfortunaly the company i was working for doesn't longer exist but overral It was an amazing experience.
                            </p>
                            I'm also working on a personal project that involves a lot of reasearchings and experimenting during my free time.
                            Click <a href="./blogs.html">here</a> to have a look at a blog I wrote that talks about the most known and used programming languages.

                        <p>
                            I also do other activities other than just studying. I'm currently working as cabinet maker, I make kitchens and furnitures, it's a manual job
                            but it gives me many satisfactions. I also dance salsa and bachata where I got the chance to meet wonderful people.
                            I'm an enterprising person willing to undertake new projects and initiatives.
                            My motto is "Don't give up, beautiful things need time in life".
