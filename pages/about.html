                            Hi, I'm Danilo. I'm currently studying web development, which has always been a passion of mine. 
                            My goal in the near future is to work as a full-stack developer, and I am willing to put in all the effort necessary to achieve this. 
                            Back in my country, I studied Coding and Computer Science, and I also completed an internship at an IT company. 
                            During the internship, I worked on a project involving programming in VB.NET using the .NET Framework, 
                            managing databases using SQL, and developing server-side web applications with PHP.
                            I also worked with different programming languages and learned their potential. </p>
                            
                        <section id = "blog-link">This is a list of blog posts talking about the most known and used programming languages.

                        </section>

                        <p>
                            In addition to studying, I enjoy participating in other activities. 
                            I have a passion for dancing salsa and bachata, and I often frequent various venues around Melbourne 
                            where I've had the opportunity to meet wonderful people. 
                            I consider myself an enterprising person, always open to taking on new projects and initiatives. 
                            <br>My motto in life is "Don't give up, beautiful things need time."
