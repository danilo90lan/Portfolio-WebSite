                        <p>Hi, I'm Danilo, I'm currently studying Web developing.
                            It's something i was always passionated about and my goal in the near future is to work as full stack developer and 
                            I'm willing to put all the effort towards this achievement.
                            When I was back in my country I studied Coding and Computer Science, 
                            I also did an internship for an IT company, working on a project that involved programming in VB.NET using .NET Framework, manage database using SQL and web developing server-side using php.       
                            I'm currently writing a <b>blog</b> that involves a lot of researchings during my free time.</p>
                            
                        <div id = "blog-link">This is a blog about the most known and used programming languages.
                            <div class = link><a href="./blogs.html">Click here</a></div>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            I also do other activities other than just studying. I like dance salsa and bachata in many places around Melbourne where I got the chance to meet wonderful people.
                            I'm an enterprising person willing to undertake new projects and initiatives.
                            <br>My motto is "Don't give up, beautiful things need time in life".
