## Purpose

The purpose of my Portfolio's website is to help illustrate my skills, abilities and attitudes to prospective employers in the development industry.

## Functionality/Features

I built my own website using HTML and CSS for styling. I used Flexbox to create the layout of each page, ensuring that each component is displayed correctly on the screen. Additionally, I considered responsiveness for multiple users, creating different layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop to optimize the user experience. 
My website is made of:

#### Header

The header includes the website's logo, the full name, and the navigation bar, which contains links to the main pages of the website, such as Home, About, Blogs, and Contact. It's placed at the top for the mobile and tablet views, but for the desktop view, I placed it on the left side to allow the main section to take up the rest of the screen.

###### Mobile view

The logo is at the top, name in the middle and the nav bar at the bottom.

###### Tablet view

The logo is at the left, name at the right and the nav bar at the bottom

###### Desktop view

For the desktop view, I used a column layout to display each element of the header, stacking them one on top of the other.

##### Footer

The footer is placed at the bottom of the page and includes essential information like the phone number, address, and social media details. The footer is consistent across all viewports, except for the desktop view where the social media icons are displayed on the left and the personal information is on the right.

#### Cards section
To create a more visually appealing layout, I displayed the main content in cards that contain images, a description of the content, and a link to the main topic.

Each card includes a hover property that reveals the card's content when the user hovers over it.

#### About

The About page contains my presentation, including my skills, abilities, and hobbies. It features a link that directly connects the user to the Blogs page, making the website more dynamic.  
Additionally, it has a button for downloading my resume.

#### Contact Form

The contact form is an essential component of the website, allowing users to easily get in touch with me for any inquiries. It consists of a simple form with text input fields for entering their message and contact details, along with a submit button to send the message.

## Site map

When I built my website, I organized the navigation between pages to be very easy and intuitive. You can access every main page from the navigation menu. Additionally, from the About page, it's possible to access the Blog page through a link located in the main section, adding more dynamism.  

The Blogs page display five different blog posts. When you open one, it links directly to the main blog, and you can navigate between each of them using the navigation arrows.

## Wireframes


To build my portfolio website, I opted for a simple yet captivating look that also appears clean and professional. I chose a blue color scheme for the header and footer, with a light grey background to provide contrast and ensuring that the content remains visually engaging. Regarding the Typography I used the "Lato" and "Roboto" fonts pairing together in order to give a sharp and professional look.
